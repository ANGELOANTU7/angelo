GENERAL RULES

Honesty: Candidates are expected to complete the test independently. Any form of plagiarism, cheating, or seeking external help is strictly prohibited.

Time Limit: Have to complete the questions within 1 week of release

Programming Languages: In some question u are free to choose programming language while in some its specified

Environment and Tools: For ROS question, you need to have Ubuntu 20.04 and ROS Noetic installed.

Submission Format: You need to fork 

Documentation: Encourage candidates to provide clear and concise documentation with their code. This includes comments, explanations, and instructions on how to run their programs or simulations.



Easy:
Question: In any programming language, write a code that constantly inputs a number and shows the average of all numbers inserted but does not accept a number that is repeated.

Sample Input & Output:

Input: 4, 4
Output: 4
Input: 4, 5
Output: 4.5
Rules and Instructions:

You can use any programming language for this question.
The program should keep reading numbers until the user decides to exit.
If a number is repeated, it should not be included in the calculation of the average.
Ensure that the code is well-documented and easy to understand.
Medium:
Question: The current position of a particle is (0,0) units. You will be provided with (velocity, direction, time interval) in unit/s, in degrees, and in seconds as an array. Write a C++ program to calculate the final position in (x, y) coordinates.

Sample Input & Output:

Input: ((5, 0, 2), (1, 45, 3), (2, -45, 1))
Output: (10.707, 0.707)
Rules and Instructions:

Write a C++ program to calculate the final position based on the given inputs.
You may assume that the particle starts at (0,0) and moves according to the provided parameters.
Make sure the code is well-structured and includes comments to explain the logic.
Hard:
Question: Install ROS Noetic on your system and implement a subscriber-publisher system in C++.

Rules and Instructions:

You need to install ROS Noetic, which requires Ubuntu 20.04. Make sure you have the necessary system requirements before attempting this question.
Implement a subscriber-publisher system in C++ using ROS. You can choose the topic and message type.
Provide documentation for setting up ROS and running your code.
The code should be well-commented and easy to understand.
You should also include a brief explanation of what your subscriber-publisher system does.
Bonus Question:
Question: Write C code in Tinkercad for Arduino to control a servo motor using a potentiometer. The servo should not go beyond 68 degrees and should turn on an LED if it exceeds 68 degrees. You need to submit a video of this circuit simulated in Tinkercad and the source code.

Rules and Instructions:

Use Tinkercad to simulate the circuit. Provide a video demonstrating the simulation.
Write C code for Arduino to control a servo motor using a potentiometer.
The servo should not go beyond 68 degrees. If it exceeds this limit, it should turn on an LED.
Share the source code along with any necessary instructions for setting up and running the simulation.
Ensure that the source code is well-commented and easy to understand.
